        		<h1>PHIL2010_William James' Indeterminism</h1>
				<h1>Prompt:</h1>
				   <p>Describe William James’ views on indeterminism. </p>
				<h1>Sample Response:</h1>  
				   <p>William James, one of the most well known American philosophers and psychologists, was a proponent of the idea
				   of free will. What was interesting about James’ position on the question of free will as opposed to determinism as 
				   that he simply asserted his position and justified it from a pragmatic perspective. One of the key points of this 
				   pragmatic perspective, as presented in James’ hallmark work “The Dilemma of Determinism,” is that determinist 
				   philosophy, by dint of what it is, ends up minimizing and trivializing mistakes, regrets, evil, and more. If human 
				   societies were to hold determinism as essentially true, then by a pragmatic perspective, what sense would there be 
				   in lamenting any evil action, regretting any terrible mistakes? If determinism is true, then nothing could have 
				   stopped that murder from happening, or that beverage from falling. The implications of determinism being correct 
				   would mean that much of how society operates would be untenable and wrong. Laws would be pointless because everything 
				   that would happen would happen anyway, so why even bother trying to prevent crime? For all that alone, James contends 
				   that the most pragmatic position is to commit to indeterminism and a belief in free will.</p>		
				   <p>As part of his arguments against determinism, James was responsible for creating the distinction of ‘hard’ and 
				   ‘soft’ determinism in the very same aforementioned literary piece. He established that ‘hard determinism’ was much 
				   more unforgiving, the true determinism philosophy wherein all is predetermined and cannot be controlled or curtailed.
				   ‘Soft determinism,’ then, as he explained, is a determinism that is even reticent to a core part of determinist belief,
				   that belief in predetermination. To contradict both of these, James presented indeterminism as the explanation for all 
				   the actions of the world, as an explanation of the chance the world experiences. Beyond describing it as a pragmatic 
				   belief, James also provided many of the foundations of future indeterminist, incompatibilist thinking.</p>	
				   <p>James provided explanation of decision processes under an indeterminist worldview, wherein there is a chance of 
				   choosing random alternatives that leads to a choice of one of those alternatives. There is chance, yes, but humans are 
				   responsible for making choices, and it is those choices that make what was once an uncertain future a concrete past. 
				   The example that James provides in “The Dilemma of Determinism” to illustrate the pragmatism of indeterminist philosophy 
				   and the reality of choice is one in which he is deciding which street to take home. He argues that determinist thinking 
				   makes no sense b being unable to say which street he will take while simultaneously saying whatever path he does take was
				   the only path he could have ever taken. His argument for indeterminism is that when he was presented with two options, 
				   each had a chance of being selected, but he chose one. Not only that, but if he regretted the option, he could only 
				   regret it if he believed he could have chosen differently, rendering determinism an insensible position.</p>	
				   <p>The conclusion that James arrives at, in all his arguments, is that indeterminism is the pragmatic philosophy because 
				   free will must exist for a normative society to exist. </p>
