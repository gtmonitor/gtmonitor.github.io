				   <p>3. Click on Setting Precedent. In the right tab bar click on Mr. Lloyd’s notes and tell me some of the challenges he faced. </p>
				   <p><mark>He faced a lot of hard work in order to publish and sell these copies of the debates. It was ambitious and in turn very straining. He only had quill pens, large sheets of paper, and a primitive form of shorthand. This combined with the complexity and quickness of the debate made it difficult.

				   <p>6. Click on The Expansion of the Empire. In the right tab bar click on the Northwest Territory Bill. What did that legislation re-affirm?  </p>
				   <p><mark>The Northwest Territory Bill resolved the issue of whether new states would be accepted into the U.S. on equal grounds of the
