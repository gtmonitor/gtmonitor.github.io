        		<h1>AmericanGov_W10 Quiz </h1>
				   <p>1. Respecting chapter eleven what Presidents does the text use for an example in the discussion of Presidential powers? </p>
				   <p><mark>The text uses Washington, Obama, and John Adams. Washington was rumored to rule more like a king than a president during his times. At the same era, people would put up the same argument that the president had become too powerful. Obama visited Africa with several flashy assets. He would come with limousines, doctors, vehicles, secret service agents, and so forth. They would say that he travelled like an emperor. John Adams was very relaxed, but he would spark widespread fear with his Alien and Sedition Acts which gives the executive branch power to remove suspicious or threatening individuals.  </mark> </p>
				   <p>2. What did Arthur Schlesinger warn about? </p>
				   <p><mark>He warned that presidents could become too power hungry that they would become emperors. He feared that sooner or later, presidents will gain too much power and it would become an imperial presidency. Republicans shared this view against Obama during his presidency.  </mark> </p>
				   <p>3. What does the text say about checks on the commander-in-chief clause? </p>
				   <p><mark>It says that the checks have faded or eroded. The Constitution gives the power to declare wars to Congress, but since the development of nuclear weapons, military response is thrusted upon the president to make snap decisions.  </mark> </p>
					<p>4. What does the text say about congressional demands following the Libyan campaign and what did the President do?  </p>
				   <p><mark>Congress wanted the administration to seek their approval under the War Powers Act, but the administration refused. With the President’s refusal to go to Congress, they would take this to court as 10 members of Congress sued Obama for violating the Constitution and the War Powers Act. </mark> </p>
				   <p>5. What President does the text use as an example in its discussion of the "Bully Pulpit"? </p>
				   <p><mark>They used President Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency. Ht was overflowing with ideas, opinions, and warnings. Roosevelt knew that an active president has the country’s ear. </mark> </p>
				   <p>6. What examples are used in the discussion of managing the public? </p>
				   <p><mark>They would directly address the citizens to win support. They would use radio, television, Twitter, and others. They would manage though media and images. President Ford slipped in public, President Johnson lifted his beagle by the ears, and President George H. W. Bush threw up at a state dinner in Japan. These would all sully your public image.   </mark> </p>				   
				   <p>7. What did the text say about Harry Truman's relationship with FDR?  </p>
				   <p><mark> They were not that close and Truman barely met President Roosevelt when he was suddenly move to the position of President after FDR’s death. It was quite sudden and Harry Truman wasn’t ready for it as he stated, “Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now.”  </mark> </p>
