				   <p>1. Click on the Thalos magazine link. Look at the article on Seeds of Victory; who developed the idea of war gardens and how did they work? </p>
				   <p><mark>The National War Garden Commission was formed to increase the supply of food grown in the US through home gardening. All citizens were encouraged to use any leftover space to create gardens which would then be harvested and the crops used to either feed the domestic population or soldiers serving overseas</mark> </p>
				   <p>2. What did the Library and Grounds Team do to make the garden realistic?  </p>
				   <p><mark>The Library and Grounds Team used period appropriate materials and practices to best emulate how war gardens were actually made back in the early 20th century. They also grew crops that would have actually been grown in war gardens.  </mark> </p>
				   <p>3. What role did the US Botanic Gardens play? </p>
				   <p><mark>The US Botanic Gardens provided the gardeners with space and materials such as pots and fertilizer which they could use to grow the war gardens. USBG gardeners also helped in the care of the plants until they could be planted in the war garden beds.  </mark> </p>
				   <p>4. What happened to the produce produced by the garden?  </p>
				   <p><mark>They are donated to a local nonprofit. They can also be given to social enterprises such as DC Central Kitchen. </mark> </p>
				   <p>5. What is the story behind the O'Neill House Office Building? </p>
				   <p><mark>It was constructed in the early 1960’s, and before being named the “O'Neill House Office Building”, it was called the Federal Office Building No. 8. It was the FDA’s first modern home which contained a lot of working space and was solely for their use. It consisted of chemists, biologists, microbiologists, and other science based jobs. They carried out many tests to ensure that certain foods complied with their standards of quality. In 2002, the FDA would leave the building due to its age and deterioration work conditions. However, in June 2017, the care of the O'Neill Building was transferred from the General Services Administration to the Architect of the Capitol where it will be preserved.  </mark> </p>
